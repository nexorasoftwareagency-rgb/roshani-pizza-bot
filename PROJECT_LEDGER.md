# Project Ledger — Prasant Pizza ERP

This file is the persistent memory for this project. Read Standing Decisions and
Fragile Files before starting ANY task.

## Standing Decisions

- **New Rider React app** (`rider-app/`) replaces old `rider/` PWA. Old `rider/` kept for
  instant rollback — do not delete until Phase 6 of implementation plan completed.
- **No Cloud Functions** (Spark plan) — all logic runs client-side or in Firebase rules.
- **PII segregation**: phone numbers go to `tableSessionsContact` (auth-gated), not `tableSessions`.
- **`_effectiveTotal(sess)`** replaces direct `sess.grandTotal` reads everywhere (table card, drawer, CSV, KPI).
- **`equalTo(null)`** (not `equalTo("")`) for unassigned rider queries — `assignedRider` is absent/null, not empty string.
- **Firebase v12**: `enableIndexedDbPersistence` removed — offline persistence is now automatic. No action needed.
- **WhatsApp validate rule** has known `.validate` path mismatch with `push()` — PRODUCTION_ISSUES.md #1.

<!-- STANDING_DECISIONS_START -->
- Rider app: `rider-app/` is the new production target
- PII in `tableSessionsContact` only
- `_effectiveTotal()` canonical
- `equalTo(null)` canonical
- Firebase v12 auto-persistence
- WhatsApp `.validate` needs fixing (see PRODUCTION_ISSUES.md)
<!-- STANDING_DECISIONS_END -->

## Fragile Files

- **`database.rules.json`** (312 lines): Complex rules for multi-outlet, multi-role access.
  Any edit must be JSON-validated and cross-checked against admin, rider, and menu apps.
  `bot/$outletId/commands` validate rule must handle `push()`-generated keys.
- **`Admin/js/features/orders.js`**: `STATUS_SEQUENCES` and `STATUS_MAPPING` must stay in
  sync with rider status pipeline (12 statuses total).
- **`firebase.json`**: 3 hosting targets (admin, rider, menu); rider CSP differs from admin.
  Rider CSP img-src currently has `http://*` — needs to match admin's `https://*`.
- **`rider-app/src/services/orderService.ts`**: Core delivery lifecycle. `resendOtp` has
  known non-atomic write bug. `assertProximity` now has GPS accuracy guard.
- **`rider-app/src/services/whatsappService.ts`**: `.validate` in database rules blocks all
  pushes. Fix both sides in sync.

<!-- FRAGILE_FILES_START -->
- database.rules.json — multi-role complex rules
- Admin/js/features/orders.js — STATUS_SEQUENCES alignment
- firebase.json — 3-target hosting, CSP divergence
- rider-app/src/services/orderService.ts — delivery lifecycle
- rider-app/src/services/whatsappService.ts — validate rule mismatch
